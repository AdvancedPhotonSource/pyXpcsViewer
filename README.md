# xpcs viewer
A python-based interactive visualization tool to view XPCS dataset.


## Supported Format

Only the APS-8IDI's XPCS data format is supported, for both multi-tau and two-time correlation. The nexus file format for XPCS measurement, which is still under
discussion, is not supported yet.

 ## Install and Uninstall

If your python environment is outdated or if you donâ€™t have python3 installed, it highly recommends installing the newest version of [anaconda3](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). 

 If you have critical python applications installed and you don't want xpcs-viewer to break their dependencies, it's recommended to setup a [virtual environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) to isolate xpcs-viewer. 

To install, open a terminal (or _"Anaconda Prompt"_ on windows) and run

```bash
pip install xpcs-viewer
```

Alternatively, you may just clone/download this repository.

To run the viewer, open a terminal (or _"Anaconda Prompt"_ on windows) and run

``` bash
run_viewer path_to_hdf_directory		# run the viewer from the hdf directory, or
run_viewer										      # run in the current directory
```

To uninstall:

``` bash
pip uninstall xpcs-viewer
```

1. The integrated scattering pattern over the whole time series.

2. The reduced one-dimensional small-angle scattering data.

3. The sample's stability against X-ray beam damage. The time series is divided into 10 sections. The SAXS-1D curve is plotted for each section.

4. Intensity fluctuation vs Time.

6. g2 plot for multitau analysis. User can fit the time scale using the single exponential function, with the option to specify the fitting range and fitting flags (fix or fit).

7. Diffusion analysis. g2 fitting in the previous panel is required to plot $\tau \mbox{vs.} q$.

8. Twotime correlation. User can select two q indexes either on the qmap or on the SAXS2D image.

9. Experiment condition viewer. It reads the file structure and string entries of the HDF file selected.
